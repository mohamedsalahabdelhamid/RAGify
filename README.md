- 💬 **Intelligent Chat**: Ask natural language questions about your documents. The AI strictly uses your documents as context.
- 📊 **Auto-Generated Dashboards**: Upload Excel/CSV files and instantly get professional, interactive charts and insights.
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**: Uses FAISS for sub-millisecond vector similarity search.
- 🔒 **Privacy First**: Your documents are chunked, embedded, and stored locally on your machine.
- 🌐 **Multi-Language UI**: Full support for English and Arabic with dynamic RTL/LTR layouts.
- 🐳 **One-Click Deployment**: Fully containerized with Docker for seamless deployment anywhere.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The easiest way to run RAGify is using Docker. You don't need to install Python, Node.js, or any other dependencies.

### 1. Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your machine.
- API Keys for the AI models (both have generous free tiers):
  - [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
  - [Groq API Key](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and prepare your environment variables:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAGify.git
cd RAGify

# Create your .env file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open the `.env` file and paste your API keys.

### 3. Run the Application

Using Docker Compose (or the provided Makefile):

```bash
# Using Makefile
make up

# OR using Docker Compose directly
docker compose up --build -d
```

That's it! 
- The **Frontend** will be available at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- The **Backend API** will be available at: [http://localhost:9999/docs](http://localhost:9999/docs)
